        About: 
        I searched a function to compare arrays and the array_diff() 
        was not specific enough. It ignores the order of the array-values. 
        So I reimplemented the diff-function which is found on unix-systems 
        but this you can use directly in your code and adopt for your needs. 
        Simply adopt the formatline-function. with the third-parameter of arr_diff() 
        you can hide matching lines. Hope someone has use for this.
