Hacking
-------

If you are interested in extending or modifying dompdf, please feel free to
contact me (Benj Carson) by email at benjcarson@digitaljunkies.ca.  If you
let me know what you'd like to try, I can maybe point you to the relevant
sections of the source.  If you've added some features, or fixed some bugs,
please send me a patch and I'll include your changes in the main
distribution.

For starters, I can point out some of the OO design patterns used in dompdf:
  
  Pattern      Classes
  -------      -------
  composite    Frame
  decorator    Frame_Decorator, *_Frame_Decorator classes
  strategy     Frame_Reflower, *_Frame_Reflower classes, Positioner,
               *_Positioner classes
  facade       dompdf
  adapter      CPDF_Adapter, PDFLib_Adapter

Also, see the main doc comment in dompdf.cls.php for a general overview of 
the rendering process.
