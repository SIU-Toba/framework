Utility directory with a few _COMPLETELY_ UNSUPPORTED utilities.
They are only made available due to some requests.

Summary
=======
Most of the file in this directory form the basis of the JpGraph
documentation system soon to be released. 

Directory ./misc
----------------

adjimg.php
	Lets you adjust the contrast, brightness and saturation
	in a image.
	Usage:adjimg.php?file=name&[b=value][&c=value][&s=scale][&sat=saturation]	

gencolorchart.php
	Generates a color chart with all colors available in
	JpGraph

mkgrad.php
	A tool to easily generate gradient images for use as backgounds

imgdbschema.inc
	A set of utility classes used to easy generate DB schema reading the
	data straight from the DB.


Directory ./jpdocgen
--------------------
This directory contains all the scripts that make up the DDDA 
documentation architecture that is used to generate the database
based documentation architecture used for JpGraph. This is completely
generic and could be used for any PHP project which needs to combine
both automtic and manual documentation.

The main entry point is jpdocedit.php


jpdb.php
	An OO interface to a MySQL database.

db_jpgraph.sql
	MySQL database scheme for the DDDA arcitecture. This also contains
	the tabels for a one example project, JpGraph. The DB
	is initially populated from the source files through the 
	jpgendb.php script.

jplintphp.php
	A very rudimentary "lint" and parser for PHP which parses 
	a valid PHP file and extracts funtions, variables and classes.
	It also checks for unused class variables and missing
	'$this->' Used as a base library for extracting class and method
	information in jpgendb.php. This contains generic classes which
	are meant to be overridden.

jplintdriver.php
	A simple driver for the parser in jplintphp.php you invoke
	this with a URL variable 'target' which is set to the file
	you would like to parse. This could be considered as a test
	harness for jplintphp.php

jpgendoc.php
	A "fancy" version of jplintdriver.php which applies some
	formatting to generate a nice template to do reference
	documentation for a PHP script file. Again, this could be
	considered a proof of concept of the basic design of the
	jplintphp.php 	

jpgendb.php
	Read one or several PHP file and add classes and methods
	to database. The classes to populate the DB from source
	are normally instantiated from jpgendoc.php and this 
	script is not meant to be called directly.

jpdbdelclass.php
	Safely delete a class from the database. Some extra safety
 	features built in to avoid greaf.

jpclassref.php
	Basic framework to read information from DB and generate
    	indexed documentation. This is a framework which needs
	a "formatter" plugin which does the actual formatting
	of the data, see jpgenhtmldoc.php for a simple implementation
	of a HTML formatter plugin.

jpgenhtmldoc.php
	Basic formatter plugin + driver to generate a HTML based
	documentation from the information stored in the DB. The
	generation of documentation is normally initialted from 
	jpdocgen.php

de_utils.php
	A number of utility classes which are used throughout the
	DDDA architecture.

jpd_editclass.php
	Main form to edit DB data for a class

jpd_editmethod.php
	Main form to edit DB data for methods

jpd_editproject.php
	Main form to edit project meta data

jpdocedit.php
	Main entry point for the DDDA architecture. Opens the main
	meny and lets the user work and update different projects as
	well as presenting statictics on the various projects.
