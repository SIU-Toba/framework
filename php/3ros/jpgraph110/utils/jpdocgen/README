DDDA Public Release
===================

This directory contains all the files necessary to
run the DDDA (Database Driven Documentation Architecture).

1. Introduction
---------------
The DDDA system lets you parse a project which may consist
of multiple PHP source file and record all classes, methods 
and global functions in a database.

When this is done you can add comments and examples which
is also stored in the database. All this is done through a
GUI provided in this application.

Whenever the source is changed you just update the DB
and the new methods and classes will be added while keeping
any old comments and description.

It will automatically calculate a percentage figure for
each class and method that indicates how well it is documented.

When you are happy with the result you can automatically
generate reference documentation from this DB.

2. Installation
---------------
1. Copy all the files to a directory of your choice.
2. Edit 'de_utils.php' to match your MySQL DB server 
settings (user and pwd)
3. Point your browser to jpdocedit.php. The first time
this script is run it will setup a few DB tables.

3. Usage
--------
Most of the use should be self explaining. 

The basic usage cycle (after the initial setup) is:

1. Parse files after code changes
2. Add documentation to classes and methods
3. Generate documentation

Go back to 1.

In the opening project window you have options to 
setup and edit one or several projects. 

The first thing you must do is to create a project 
and define a number of files belonging to this project. 
After that you need to update the DB by first going 
into the project view and then pressing the 'Update DB' 
button. Note that the update function is smart enough
not to parse files which are up to date. 
(By clicking the 'Force' checkbox you can force all files
in the project to be parsed)

Then click on the methods or class names where you
want to add documentation. To help keep track of your
documentation effort there is a weighted tracking system
built in which will give you, as a percentage, the 
documentation coverage. This will help direct your efforts
to the classes most in need of more documentation.

When you like to generate the documentation you just need
to press the "Generate docs" button and the HTML files
will be written to the output directory you have specified.

Some notes:
The button "Check DB" performs a consistency check on
the DB. 
The button "Show documentation" opens the generated 
documentations.
The button "Update DB" runs the parser of any files that
has been modified since the last time parsing was done.


4. Browser compatibility
------------------------
I have only tested this with Opera 6.x and at the moment
it will not work with MS IE due to (what I consider) bugs
in IE. 

When I get some time I will add some workarounds for the
bugs in IE.
