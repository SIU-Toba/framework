Simple Test interface changes
=============================
Because the SimpleTest tool set is still evolving it is likely that tests
written with earlier versions will fail with the newest ones. The most
dramatic changes are in the alpha releases. Here is a list of possible
problems...

No HTML when matching page elements
-----------------------------------
This behaviour has been switched to using plain text as if it
were seen by the user of the browser. This means that HTML tags
are suppressed, entities are converted and whitespace is
normalised. This should make it easier to match items in forms.
Also images are replaced with their "alt" text so that they
can be matched as well.

No method SimpleRunner::_getTestCase()
--------------------------------------
This was made public as getTestCase() in 1.0RC2.

No method restartSession()
--------------------------
This was renamed to restart() in the WebTestCase, SimpleBrowser
and the underlying SimpleUserAgent in 1.0RC2. Because it was
undocumented anyway, no attempt was made at backward
compatibility.

My custom test case ignored by tally()
--------------------------------------
The _assertTrue method has had it's signature changed due to a bug
in the PHP 5.0.1 release. You must now use getTest() from within
that method to get the test case.

Broken code extending SimpleRunner
----------------------------------
This was replaced with SimpleScorer so that I could use the runner
name in another class. This happened in RC1 development and there
is no easy backward compatibility fix. The solution is simply to
extend SimpleScorer instead.

Missing method getBaseCookieValue()
-----------------------------------
This was renamed getCurrentCookieValue() in RC1.

Missing files from the SimpleTest suite
---------------------------------------
Versions of SimpleTest prior to Beta6 required a SIMPLE_TEST constant
to point at the SimpleTest folder location before any of the toolset
was loaded. This is no longer documented as it is now unnecessary
for later versions. If you are using an earlier version you may
need this constant. Consult the documentation that was bundled with
the release that you are using or upgrade to Beta6 or later.

No method SimpleBrowser::getCurrentUrl()
--------------------------------------
This is replaced with the more versatile showRequest() for
debugging. It only existed in this context for version Beta5.
Later versions will have SimpleBrowser::getHistory() for tracking
paths through pages. It is renamed as getUrl() since 1.0RC1.

No method Stub::setStubBaseClass()
----------------------------------
This method has finally been removed in 1.0RC1. Use
SimpleTestOptions::setStubBaseClass() instead.

No class CommandLineReporter
----------------------------
This was renamed to TextReporter in Beta3 and the deprecated version
was removed in 1.0RC1.

No method requireReturn()
-------------------------
This was deprecated in Beta3 and is now removed.

No method expectCookie()
------------------------
This method was abruptly removed in Beta4 so as to simplify the internals
until another mechanism can replace it. As a workaround it is necessary
to assert that the cookie has changed by setting it before the page
fetch and then assert the desired value.

No method clickSubmitByFormId()
-------------------------------
This method had an incorrect name as no button was involved. It was
renamed to submitByFormId() in Beta4 and the old version deprecated.
Now removed.

No method paintStart() or paintEnd()
------------------------------------
You should only get this error if you have subclassed the lower level
reporting and test runner machinery. These methods have been broken
down into events for test methods, events for test cases and events
for group tests. The new methods are...

paintStart() --> paintMethodStart(), paintCaseStart(), paintGroupStart()
paintEnd() --> paintMethodEnd(), paintCaseEnd(), paintGroupEnd()

This change was made in Beta3, ironically to make it easier to subclass
the inner machinery. Simply duplicating the code you had in the previous
methods should provide a temporary fix.

No class TestDisplay
--------------------
This has been folded into SimpleReporter in Beta3 and is now deprecated.
It was removed in RC1.

No method WebTestCase::fetch()
------------------------------
This was renamed get() in Alpha8. It is removed in Beta3.

No method submit()
------------------
This has been renamed clickSubmit() in Beta1. The old method was
removed in Beta2.

No method clearHistory()
------------------------
This method is deprecated in Beta2 and removed in RC1.

No method getCallCount()
------------------------
This method has been deprecated since Beta1 and has now been
removed. There are now more ways to set expectations on counts
and so this method should be unecessery. Removed in RC1.

Cannot find file *
------------------
The following public name changes have occoured...

simple_html_test.php --> reporter.php
simple_mock.php --> mock_objects.php
simple_unit.php --> unit_tester.php
simple_web.php --> web_tester.php

The old names were deprecated in Alpha8 and removed in Beta1.

No method attachObserver()
--------------------------
Prior to the Alpha8 release the old internal observer pattern was
gutted and replaced with a visitor. This is to trade flexibility of
test case expansion against the ease of writing user interfaces.

Code such as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->attachObserver(new TestHtmlDisplay());
$test->run();

...should be rewritten as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->run(new HtmlReporter());

If you previously attached multiple observers then the workaround
is to run the tests twice, once with each, until they can be combined.
For one observer the old method is simulated in Alpha 8, but is
removed in Beta1.

No class TestHtmlDisplay
------------------------
This class has been renamed to HtmlReporter in Alpha8. It is supported,
but deprecated in Beta1 and removed in Beta2. If you have subclassed
the display for your own design, then you will have to extend this
class (HtmlReporter) instead.

If you have accessed the event queue by overriding the notify() method
then I am afraid you are in big trouble :(. The reporter is now
carried around the test suite by the runner classes and the methods
called directly. In the unlikely event that this is a problem and
you don't want to upgrade the test tool then simplest is to write your
own runner class and invoke the tests with...

$test->accept(new MyRunner(new MyReporter()));

...rather than the run method. This should be easier to extend
anyway and gives much more control. Even this method is overhauled
in Beta3 where the runner class can be set within the test case. Really
the best thing to do is to upgrade to this version as whatever you were
trying to achieve before should now be very much easier.

Missing set options method
--------------------------
All test suite options are now in one class called SimpleTestOptions.
This means that options are set differently...

GroupTest::ignore() --> SimpleTestOptions::ignore()
Mock::setMockBaseClass() --> SimpleTestOptions::setMockBaseClass()

These changed in Alpha8 and the old versions are now removed in RC1.

No method setExpected*()
------------------------
The mock expectations changed their names in Alpha4 and the old names
ceased to be supported in Alpha8. The changes are...

setExpectedArguments() --> expectArguments()
setExpectedArgumentsSequence() --> expectArgumentsAt()
setExpectedCallCount() --> expectCallCount()
setMaximumCallCount() --> expectMaximumCallCount()

The parameters remained the same.
