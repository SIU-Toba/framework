Javascript syntax highlighting editor

(yes, its written in javascript)

TODO


+ done: Mozilla compatibility
  fix sizes, fix range code, use the W3C DOM methods only
  change hardcoded size info into configurable variables
- multiple line selections
  - catch shift-down and shift-up, as well as pgup, pgdown versions
    solution idea: enlarge the textarea, copy the new line contents in it
    on unselect (if changed) commit the entire textarea
  - also catch mousedown and up events
- multiple line copy/paste
  - its a textarea now, so it should be simple to check whether a paste resulted in
    more than one line. If so, commit them all.
- undo/redo
  - it should be possible to build an unlimited undo/redo, at least
    if we only undo line by line. Just keep a log of changes via updateLine
    deleteLine and insertLine..
- grow the input line when entering lines longer than the current size of the input line
- create a menu bar, with text size, load, save, undo, redo, etc.
+ done: autoindent the next line when pressing enter (configurable)
+ done: support tabs
- support different tabsizes configurable
