    security-token is implemented in server code.

    It serves as a placeholder that signals when a gadget requires a security
    token for proper operation. It does not indicate where the token is needed
    (fragment or query string).

    This feature is referenced and used in a few ways:
    a. Other features that require a security token, such as opensocial,
       will depend on it. The transitive closure of the dependency tree thus
       indicates such requests require a security token.
    b. As noted in (a), metadata requests may be formed for a gadget which
       request whether or not a security token is needed for rendering the
       gadget. This makes it possible to intelligently choose when to mint
       and include a security token during rendering.
    c. As a corollary to (a) and (b), this feature depends on locked-domain,
       again to provide a clear mechanism for containers to render gadgets
       on the locked-domain when rendered in an IFRAME. This ensures token security.
    d. Another corollary to (a) and (b), a dep on auth-refresh ensures it too
       is pulled in when necessary. This obviates the need for containers to
       manually append &libs=auth-refresh to support this.
    e. GadgetSpec processing code automatically includes this feature when
       OAuth tags are included in the gadget, signaling the token's need.
