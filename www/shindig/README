    Apache with mod_rewrite enabled.

  Disk:
    No minimum requirement. 
  Operating System:
    No minimum requirement. On Windows, Windows NT and above or Cygwin is

  Installing Shindig
  ------------------

  Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. shindig-1.1-BETA5-incubating-php.zip to 
  the web document root, e.g. /var/www/html. 

  Rename the created shindig-1.1-BETA5-incubating-php dir to shindig. 

  a. Create a new virtual host

  Point your Apache to the shindig dir with a virtual host like:

  <VirtualHost your_ip:your_port>
         ServerName your.host
         DocumentRoot /var/www/html/shindig
         ... other normal settings in vhosts...
    <Directory>
      AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

  Restart apache, and point your browser to:

  http://<your.host>/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml

  b. Run with an existing host

  If you cannot/don't want to create a virtual host, you can edit the file 
  php/config/container.php or php/config/local.php (see the comments 
  php/config/container.php for documentation of the configuration system) 
  and change the web_prefix setting to '/shindig/php'.

  In this case, you should also change all paths in shindig/config/container.js
  (see the comments there for documentation of the JSON configuration system).

  Then you can run the gadget by pointing your browser to:

  http://<your.host>/shindig/php/gadgets/ifr?url=http://www.labpixies.com/campaigns/todo/todo.xml

  Going forward
  -------------
  
  Check out the php/config/container.php file, in local.php you only have 
  to specificy the fields you want to overwrite with other values, for 
  example on a production system you would probably want to have something
  like:
   $shindigConfig = array(
    'debug' => false,
    'allow_plaintext_token' => false,
    'token_cipher_key' => 'MySecretKey',
    'token_hmac_key' => 'MyOtherSecret',
    'private_key_phrase' => 'MyCertificatePassword',
    'person_service' => 'MyPeopleService',
    'activity_service' => 'MyActivitiesService',
    'app_data_service' => 'MyAppDataService',
    'messages_service' => 'MyMessagesService',
    'oauth_lookup_service' => 'MyOAuthLookupService'
    'xrds_location' => 'http://www.mycontainer.com/xrds',
    'check_file_exists' => false
   );
 
  And then implement your own service and oauth lookup classes.
